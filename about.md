### More Information

Hi, and welcome! I’m part of the Contributor Catalyst program at UCSC, where I’m exploring open source and community building. I’m a rising senior studying computer science at Norfolk State University. Through this blog, I’ll be sharing reflections on my journey as a contributor and lessons from hands-on projects. Glad you’re here!
