title: Goal Update!
---

Coming into this program, I was new to open source and eager to learn. One of the strengths I bring is a strong work ethic. I am someone who is willing to start from the beginning and keep going until I figure things out. At the same time, I wanted to challenge myself to grow in an area I am less familiar with: collaboration. I am used to working on my own, so improving how I work in teams became one of my main goals.

Over the past few weeks, I have made real progress. I have been working more in group settings and have started to feel more comfortable with the open-source workflow. I am getting better at contributing to team projects, sharing ideas, asking questions, and supporting others' work. These experiences have helped me understand what it really means to be part of a collaborative environment, especially one where people rely on each other's code and communication.

As we approach the last two weeks of the program, I want to keep building on that. I plan to stay open to new ways of working with others, continue showing up in team discussions. I also want to stay thoughtful about how I give and receive feedback so I can continue growing both technically and interpersonally.

Emily, Silas, and Samir have been a big part of that growth. Their mentorship and encouragement have made it easier for me to step into group work with more confidence. They have supported me not only by answering questions, but also by modeling what strong and respectful teamwork looks like. I am grateful for that and excited to carry these lessons with me moving forward.
