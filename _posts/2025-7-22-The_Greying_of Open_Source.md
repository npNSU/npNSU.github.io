title: The Greying of Open Source Reflection
---

I would say that Abigail Cabunoc Mayes’s talk reflects my experience. Abigail discussed the heavy workload that maintainers often take on, which aligns with what I have seen in the lab. It can lead to longer response times and a lot of unseen work. Maintainers are not just writing code; They are answering questions, supporting communities, and handling many behind-the-scenes tasks. Often, they do not receive the recognition they deserve. Her talk made me think about how burnout can be built into the system and how unclear the path can be for new contributors who want to get involved or move into leadership.

As someone from Gen Z, I would add that many of us are eager to contribute but are unsure of where to start. We care deeply about impact, collaboration, and community. However, open source can sometimes feel like a space where you already need to know everything to participate. What would help is more peer-to-peer support, clearly defined roles beyond coding, and a culture that embraces casual learning. Seeing people our age actively contributing and being appreciated in those spaces can also be very encouraging.

What would really help bring more of my peers into open source is making the entry points feel more welcoming and less intimidating. Beginner-friendly tasks with step-by-step guidance can make a big difference, especially for those who are still learning. Social spaces, such as Discord servers, where people can ask questions and connect, help build confidence and community. It is also important to offer opportunities for non-technical contributions, such as writing, design, or outreach. Many of us are motivated by impact, so hearing real stories about how open source changes lives makes the work feel more meaningful. Lastly, visible forms of recognition, like digital badges or contributor shoutouts, can help people feel valued for their efforts.

Abigail’s talk was a necessary reminder that the future of open source depends on making it more accessible, supportive, and sustainable for the next generation. Many of us are ready to get involved; we just need better ways to take that first step.
