During our lab, we had the chance to dive into open-source projects to get a better sense of how different software communities work. One of the larger projects I explored was p5.js, a JavaScript library that helps people create interactive, and geometric art. p5.js is part of the Processing Foundation, an organization focused on promoting learning and exploration through code, particularly in artistic and creative spaces. What I really appreciate about the Foundation is that it’s not just about teaching people how to write software. It’s also about building a welcoming and inclusive environment where anyone can explore technology and creativity, no matter their experience level or background. 

Currently, the project has 678 contributors and over 24,000 users. In just the last 30 days, there have been 15 active contributors and 71 commits, which shows that the project is actively maintained and highlights the benefits with a larger community. On GitHub, new issues are opened regularly, sometimes even multiple times an hour. This high level of engagement highlights how responsive and dedicated the developer community is when it comes to maintaining and improving the library.

If I were to contribute, my first step would be to visit the project’s GitHub page and thoroughly review the README file. The “Get Started for Contributors” section links to the official p5.js website, where new contributors can find a lot of helpful resources. These include reference documentation, tutorials, a setup guide, and system architecture documentation. Most bug reports and feature suggestions are handled through the GitHub issue tracker. Now, there are about 320 open issues, many of which involve active discussions, proposed fixes, or enhancements.

Downloading and installing p5.js is a quick and simple process. Many users say it takes five minutes or less. You can either use the hosted script link provided on the website or download the full library directly to get started right away.

Developers and contributors stay connected through GitHub, Slack, Discord, and other community platforms. These spaces include dedicated channels for contributors, team leads, and new users, which helps keep communication clear and collaboration strong.

What stood out most to me during this exploration was seeing how community-driven and welcoming p5.js is. The project emphasizes inclusivity and education, encouraging beginners while still supporting experienced developers.

When comparing it to the smaller project we studied earlier, OpenSSF Scorecard, there were many differences. Scorecard is focused on security and risk evaluation, which is more technical. While p5.js, is creative, collaborative, and visually engaging.

Given the choice, I would prefer to contribute to p5.js. As it aligns more closely with my interests, offers various ways to get involved, and feels more engaging overall.
