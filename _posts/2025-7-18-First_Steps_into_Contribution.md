title: First Steps into Contribution
---

This past week, the Processing Team focused on selecting an open-source project to contribute to. We began by evaluating four potential projects: p5.js, Runestone Academy, Internet in a Box, and OpenSearch. After much discussion, we decided to go with Processing, specifically the core Processing project (branch over p5.js)

Next, we explored related repositories and selected three to investigate further: Processing4, the p5.js Web Editor, and p5.js. Each team member took on the task of setting up the development environment for one of these repositories. I worked on Processing4, which had the smoothest setup process and only took a few minutes to get running. The other environments required a bit more time and troubleshooting.

After setting up, we searched each repository for “Good First Issues” that would be suitable for new contributors. Although we did not find many that were truly beginner-friendly, we discovered one in the Processing4 repository that had already been claimed but had seen no progress for some time. We were able to replicate the issue on both macOS 15.5 and Windows 11, and we posted our findings in the issue thread to ask if we could take over the task.

Now we are waiting for a response.

Based on what I’ve learned so far, the next issue I think would be good to work on is one that involves fixing a small UI bug or improving documentation, as these types of issues are typically less complex but still valuable to the project and provide a great opportunity to become more familiar with the codebase. I believe our team is ready to take on a small to medium issue that goes a bit deeper than the one we're currently waiting to hear back on. Tackling this next step would help build our confidence before moving on to more complex issues involving deeper logic.
