title: Final Reflections!! Yay!
---

Nearly eight weeks ago, I set a personal goal to improve my time management by creating a consistent routine and prioritizing tasks more effectively. Since then, I have made strong progress and developed habits that help me stay focused, meet deadlines, and approach each day with greater structure. Even during busier weeks, I remained committed to my schedule and adjusted as needed without falling behind. Moving forward, I plan to continue refining my routine and setting clear goals at the start of each week. I believe regular check-ins with a mentor would also help me stay motivated and provide valuable guidance as I build on this progress.

Over the past few weeks, I worked on several issues across the p5.js Web Editor, p5.js, and Processing 4 projects. In the p5.js Web Editor, my team and I addressed Issue #3079, which involved the “Upload File” button being hidden when users are not logged in. We submitted a pull request aimed at improving the user experience and aligning the feature with accessibility guidelines. In the main p5.js repository, we tackled Issue #6660, related to missing TypeScript overloads where parameters marked as “optional” were not handled correctly at runtime. We developed and submitted a pull request proposing a solution, building on previous attempts and maintainer feedback.

In Processing 4, I collaborated with my team, Amante’, Kayla, and Silas, on several issues. For Issue #1190, a macOS-specific debugging breakpoint problem, we developed and submitted a pull request addressing key aspects and suggesting improvements. Additionally, we made significant progress on Issue #981, which involved migrating the ‘dxf’ library to Gradle. After a previous pull request was closed due to broad changes, we submitted a cleaner, more focused pull request referencing earlier implementations. Throughout this work, we maintained communication with maintainers who provided valuable guidance and insights.

The most challenging issue to engage with was Issue #3079, which involved improving accessibility features in the p5.js Web Editor. Accessibility coding requires careful attention to detail and extensive research to meet the necessary standards. Working under a tight time constraint made this especially difficult, as ensuring compliance while delivering a functional solution demanded significant effort and focus.

The most rewarding issue for me was Issue #981 in the Processing 4 project. This was the first issue I discovered and submitted a pull request for alongside my team. Taking ownership of this issue and seeing our contribution progress through the review process showed me how fulfilling open-source contribution can be. It reinforced my confidence and motivated me to continue engaging with complex projects.

The most valuable thing I learned as a Catalyst Fellow was how collaborative and iterative open source development truly is. Working with a team on real issues helped me understand the importance of clear communication, patience while waiting for feedback, and adapting solutions based on the maintainer’s guidance. I also gained hands-on experience navigating complex codebases and submitting pull requests, which gave me a deeper appreciation for the open source community and the meaningful impact that even small contributions can make.

At this time, I do not plan to continue contributing to open source projects beyond this program. While I appreciate the learning experience and the skills I have gained, I feel that my current focus and interests lie elsewhere. However, I remain grateful for the opportunity to participate and grow as a developer. I would still be interested in other ways to stay connected with the community, such as helping to improve the program for future participants or offering peer support, as I believe sharing knowledge is important.
