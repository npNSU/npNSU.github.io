title: Motivation :)

One challenge I would like to tackle with technology would be education inequality. Specifically, improving access to quality learning opportunities for all students. When I am successful, the first person I would tell about it would be my mom, as she is a major source of motivation and support for me. 

An open-source project that directly addresses education inequality would be [Oppia](https://github.com/oppia/oppia), an open-source platform for creating interactive educational content and lessons. (One-on-one tutor lessons and high-quality learning content accessible to students all over the world.) I think they would be a good project to contribute to as they allow new contributors, and they have plenty of "good first issue" labels for me to explore and get started on.
