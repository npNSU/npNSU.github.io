Hello! My name is Nia Perez. I am a rising senior at Norfolk State University. I am majoring in Computer Science. I currently live in Norfolk, Virginia, but I am originally from Dallas, Texas. 

I don't have any open-source experience, but I am excited to learn. I think my strongest skill that I can bring to this team is my work-ethic, as I am not afraid to start from scratch if all else fails. A skill I would like to work on is my collaboration skills, as I am used to solo working environments. 

I am also participating in the University of Santa Cruz Contributor Catalyst program. Keep up with our work [here](https://github.com/emmet0r/contributor-catalyst)
