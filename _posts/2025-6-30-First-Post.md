Hello! My name is Nia Perez. I’m a rising senior majoring in Computer Science at Norfolk State University. I currently live in Norfolk, Virginia, but I’m originally from Dallas, Texas.

While I’m new to open source, I’m excited to learn and grow. One of my strongest qualities is my work ethic. I am not afraid to start from scratch and keep pushing until I figure things out. I’m also hoping to improve my collaboration skills, since I’m used to working independently.

I’m currently part of the University of California, Santa Cruz Contributor Catalyst program. You can keep up with our work [here.](https://github.com/emmet0r/contributor-catalyst)
