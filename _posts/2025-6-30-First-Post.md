Hello! My name is Nia Perez. I am a rising senior at Norfolk State University. I am majoring in Computer Science. I currently live in Norfolk, Virginia, but I am originally from Dallas, Texas. 

I don't have any open-source experience, but I am excited to learn. I think my strongest skill that I can bring to this team is my work-ethic, as I am not afraid to start from scratch if all else fails. A skill I would like to work on is my collaboration skills, as I am used to working by myself.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
